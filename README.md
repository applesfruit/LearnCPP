# LearnCPP
LearnC++ is a console application created in C++ to assist people in learning C++.

Keep in mind that while making this, I am also learning C++ in the process.

This was just a fun project idea that I had while learning C++ and I was like "why not just make a project idea of it."

This project is not meant to help you fully learn C++, only to assist with certain aspects, it's only meant for fun and code examples and other stuff.

I will keep on adding to this until I get a fully complete project, where I will release a compiled binary, until then you can compile it by opening it in Visual Studio and building it.
